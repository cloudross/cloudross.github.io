This evening I have been further exploring Azure IoT. At home I use <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> and have a whole array of smart devices - from lighting routines to monitoring power consumption of certain devices, and a whole lot more.

I have started looking at how I can gather telemetry from Home Assistant and send this into Azure for further analysis.

I hope to write a more detailed blog post at some point in the future if I can get something meaningful working beyond a few test messages!
