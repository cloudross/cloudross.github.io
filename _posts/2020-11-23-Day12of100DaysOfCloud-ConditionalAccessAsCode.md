title: Conditional Access (As Code) [100DaysOfCloud Day 12/100]

I have long been an advocate of Conditional Access used in conjunction with Azure Active Directory. It is a fantastic tool in your armoury for securing user access to Office 365 and other services powered by Azure AD.

Earlier this year Microsoft extended the API capabilities which allow us to interact with the Conditional Access service as admins. Now rather than reinventing the wheel here, I just want to quickly share some great examples of this capability "Condtional Access (as code)" which I think can really help!
