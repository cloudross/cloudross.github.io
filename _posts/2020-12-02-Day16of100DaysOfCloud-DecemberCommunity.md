###### Festive Tech Calendar

This is for the community by the community, each day throughout December brings more fantastic content (and I think also some prizes!)

One positive to the pandemic, I have personally found it great to attend lots of different Azure/Cloud User Groups outwith my local area!

There are a ton of fantastic groups out there with lots of great people doing fantastic work in the community but here are just some of the groups I have been visiting over the last few months and their upcoming events this month.
