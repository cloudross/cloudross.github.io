Following on from the Welsh Azure User Group last week, I have been working through the Cloud Skills Challenge which was announced.

This challenge is a series of Microsoft Learn modules, each with a connection to Open Source. By completing 5 or more modules in the challenge you are also entered into a prize draw!

Despite already having knowledge in a lot of these areas and these being introductory modules I have worked through the below today. In the cloud and modern technology landscape we live in, I find it is important to go back over things you already know as the technology is continually changing so it is a good opportunity to both validate your existing knowledge and probably learn something new!
