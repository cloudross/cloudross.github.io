Following on from yesterday, again I have been continuing through the modules in the <a href="https://aka.ms/challenge/waug" target="_blank">Cloud Skills Challenge</a> to get them completed!

Tonight was also the last Glasgow Azure User Group of 2020. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie" target="_blank">@gregor_suttie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/techielass" target="_blank">@techielass (Sarah)</a>for organising as always.

First up was an announcement that Glasgow are also taking part in the Cloud Skills Challenge - you can sign up here - <a href="https://aka.ms/challenge/gaug " target="_blank">https://aka.ms/challenge/gaug </a>

Two fantastic speakers then took to the virtual stage...
